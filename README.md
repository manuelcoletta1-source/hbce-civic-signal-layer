# HBCE Civic Signal Layer (CSL) v0.1
Consultive · Opposable · Auditable — EU-first civic voting signal layer.

---

## Overview

HBCE Civic Signal Layer (CSL) is a consultive civic voting infrastructure 
where access requires an activated IPR (EU base activation contract).

This system is:

- Consultive (not legally binding)
- Opposable (each vote generates a cryptographic receipt)
- Auditable (append-only public hash ledger)
- EU-first aligned
- Fail-closed by design

CSL is not a social network.

It is a structured civic signal environment designed to test 
territorial voting integrity under cryptographic accountability.

---

## Access Model

Entry requires:

- Activated IPR (EU base activation)
- Territorial eligibility verification (hash-only)
- Cryptographic key pair linked to IPR

Public identity may remain pseudonymous.
Custody of legal identity remains external and protected.

---

## Territorial Scope

Voting domains are hierarchical and federated:

- Neighborhood
- City
- Region
- State
- European Union

Users can vote only within their verified territorial scope.

---

## Voting Model

Users can:

- View proposals
- Cast vote (YES / NO / ABSTAIN)
- Receive opposable cryptographic receipt

Users cannot:

- Comment
- Chat
- Publish content
- Edit ledger entries

This ensures signal clarity and structural integrity.

---

## Ledger Principles

- Append-only structure
- Hash-linked entries
- Public verification
- Fail-closed validation
- No mutable history

Each vote produces:

- Signed vote object
- Timestamp
- Hash entry
- Receipt for independent verification

---

## Legal Position

CSL v0.1 is experimental and consultive.

It does not replace:
- Municipal elections
- Regional elections
- National elections
- European Parliament elections

It is a civic signal layer for research, testing, and governance modeling.
